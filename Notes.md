## 0. Preliminaries: Sets, Functions, Cardinality, and Sequences
(Some may be familar in your Discrete Math course, but some else in here is beyond the scope of Discrete Math.)

Notion: 
"**x ∈ A**" means "x is an element of the set A"
"**A ⊆ B**" means "A is a subset of the set B"

**Definition:** Let A and B be sets. A **function** f: A-->B is a rule assigning to each x∈A exactly one f(x) ∈ B. A is the domain, and B is the codomain.

**Images and Inverse Images:** Let f:A-->B be a function.

1. If A'⊆ A, we define the **image** of A' to be: f(A') = { b∈B | b = f(a) for some a∈A'} = { f(a) | a∈A'}

2. If B'⊆ B, the **inverse image** of B' is: f<sup>-1</sup>(B') = { a∈A | f(a)∈B'}

Note that the definition of inverse images always makes sense even if there's no inverse function.
